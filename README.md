# SegaController #

This is my fork of the Jon Thysell's SegaController project found at https://github.com/jonthysell/SegaController.  The primary purpose of this fork is to provide capabilities to my other project RetroSpy, which can be found at https://github.com/zoggins/RetroSpy.  The original README can be found at https://gitbub.com/zoggins/SegaController/README-ORIG.md.
