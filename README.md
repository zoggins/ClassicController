# ClassicControllerSpy #

This is my fork of the Jon Thysell's SegaController project found at https://github.com/jonthysell/SegaController.  The primary purpose of this fork is to provide capabilities to my other project RetroSpy, which can be found at https://github.com/zoggins/RetroSpy.  My additions to this library are a passive monitor for Sega Genesis controller activity, SMS/Atari/Commodore joystick class and the Omega Race Booster Grip.  I would really like to get the Atari Keyboard Controller and Atari Paddles working, but I am having difficulties getting them to work consistently.  Also on my to do list is Playstation controllers and Atari Driving Controller.
