# ClassicControllerSpy #

This is my fork of the Jon Thysell's SegaController project found at https://github.com/jonthysell/SegaController.  The primary purpose of this fork is to provide capabilities to my other project RetroSpy, which can be found at https://github.com/zoggins/RetroSpy.  My additions to this library are a passive monitor for Sega Genesis controller activity, SMS/Atari/Commodore joystick class and the Omega Race Booster Grip.  On my todo list is the Atari Keyboard Controller, Atari paddles and Atari Driving Controller.
