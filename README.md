# SegaController #

This is my fork of the Jon Thysell's SegaController project found at https://github.com/jonthysell/SegaController.  The primary purpose of this fork is to provide capabilities to my other project RetroSpy, which can be found at https://github.com/zoggins/RetroSpy.  My additions to this library are a passive monitor for a Sega Genesis controller, a standalone SMS/Atari joystick class and support for the Omega Race Booster Grip.
